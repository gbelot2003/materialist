# Materialist

**This is another attempt to merge drupal 7 and [materialize!](https://www.materializecss.com)**
This theme is under development, so use it *on your own risk* on deployment sites, however, I'll try to write enouth documentation to make it easy to the costumize ;)

**TODO**
- there is a hash problem with javascript files, it needs review.
- need's to theme the comment buttons output, in order to make materialize classes defaut.
- date and other elements from node.tpl need work and style.
- create a way to chage color from theme form (colors module and stuff).
- need to figured how to print the nav dropdows
