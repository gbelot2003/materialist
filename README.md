# Materialist

**This is another attempt to merge drupal 7 and [materialize!](https://www.materializecss.com)**
This theme is under development, so use it *on your own risk* on deployment sites, however, I'll try to write enouth documentation to make it easy to the costumize ;)

## Instructions
Rigth now it works with sass-compass, you can read the details on the confi.rb on the root folder.
As you will see, if you what to use it, you need to download the repo of [materialize!](https://www.materializecss.com) (the full one with sass files include)and place it on the root folder
of the sass files inclided. there is no sass structure yet, just some basic styles from the example of templates on materializecss site. so you can 
get dirty hands.

I plane to move sass to nodejs platform in order to add **webpack and bower functionality, but that will be later on.

The Css defaults are rewrited, so it's posible to fine some minor conflicts but minima(I hope ;)).
